Proposal Paragraph:

Our web appâ€™s target population is parents or expecting parents. This fits the project theme as none of us are parents or expect to be parents anytime soon (I hope). As college students we are mostly concerned with our personal well-being, this is not bad but parents have a completely different mindset as their priority is the well-being of their children. We want to build an application that can assist parents of all kinds to find homes that are suitable for raising children as well as giving current parents a way to verify that their current home is in a good location.

Some possible resources that we can use our databases with crime statistics, sex-offender registries, and any other statistic that can check the safety of a location. We will also want to use some map API so we can check if there are schools, hospitals, and parks nearby as well as using it to display search locations on a map.
