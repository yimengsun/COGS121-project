milestone3 Submission
1. milestone3.md is present in our project's GitHub repository.

2. milestone3.md contains screenshots of your latest UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file.
-------------------------------------------------
3. milestone3.md contains a written explanation of how your UI skeleton screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone2.md in a noticeable way.

4.We will show our TA how our UI skeletons improved in a noticeable way from what we showed them during Milestone 2 grading session. (During our in-person grading session, we will show our milestone2.md to compare to your old screenshots.)

5. We will explain to our TA what database or data API we chose, and why we chose it.

6. We will successfully live demo at least one Ajax interaction where our TA can trigger some action on one of our webpages, it fetches some data from a backend database or external data API, and then displays that data directly on our webpage without reloading it. A simple text-based display is fine at this point. (2 points)

7. Our database or external data API functionality is relevant to our project (in other words, it's not just directly copied from Professor Guo's example code without meaningful modifications).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. You can confirm that your project is not simply using data from a text file (such as a .csv or .json file) or hard-coding objects into your JavaScript code.---------------------------------------------------------------

9. You can properly use the Network Inspector tab in your web browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to show your TA exactly what data is being passed between the frontend and backend (or external web API) during these Ajax interactions. (2 points)---------------------------------------------------------

10. You can properly explain to your TA how your database or external data API interaction works in detail by walking through the code that you wrote for it, both in your frontend and backend. (3 points)--------------------------------------------------------------------

11. You tell your TA a plausible plan for how you are going to meaningfully display or visualize the data on the frontend for future milestones. You don't need to necessarily stick with this plan, but you must at least propose a plan.---------------------------------------
