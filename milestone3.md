1. milestone3.md is present in our project's GitHub repository.

2. milestone3.md contains screenshots of your latest UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file.

3. milestone3.md contains a written explanation of how your UI skeleton screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone2.md in a noticeable way.

4.We will show our TA how our UI skeletons improved in a noticeable way from what we showed them during Milestone 2 grading session. (During our in-person grading session, we will show our milestone2.md to compare to your old screenshots.)

5. We will explain to our TA what database or data API we chose, and why we chose it.

6. We will successfully live demo at least one Ajax interaction where our TA can trigger some action on one of our webpages, it fetches some data from a backend database or external data API, and then displays that data directly on our webpage without reloading it. A simple text-based display is fine at this point. 

7. Our database or external data API functionality is relevant to our project. We want to build a website for parents and expecting parents, so that they can find a good location to settle down and raise their children. We have datasets and databases that can tell us about the the traffic levels around the city area we are looking up in California. Other datasets tell us about the children in the area. Datasets show how they are healthy and in shape, and another dataset shows how well children in the area score in school. Both are important things to consider as a parents or expecting parents because the surrounding area and children that kids will grow up in will determine what they will become as young adult.

8. We can confirm that our project is not simply using data from a text file (such as a .csv or .json file) or hard-coding objects into your JavaScript code. We have a real databases and get data based on locations we input.

9. We can properly use the Network Inspector tab in our web browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to show our TA exactly what data is being passed between the frontend and backend (or external web API) during these Ajax interactions. 

10. We can properly explain to our TA how our database or external data API interaction works in detail by walking through the code that we wrote for it, both in our frontend and backend. 

11. We tell our TA a plausible plan for how we are going to meaningfully display or visualize the data on the frontend for future milestones. We will get all of the information that we have for our city or our area. Then we will devise a way to set up a score or a rating system with all of the information displayed clearly. We want to show that our area has a good rating in several aspects. We will let the parents see exactly what they are looking into so they can make a informed decision. Having a chart of the data in front of the user will be the best way to make them better.
