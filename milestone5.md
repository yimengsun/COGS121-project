1. milestone5.md is present in our project's GitHub repository.
2. milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing how someone in your target user population would use your app in order to help them achieve relevant goals. 

Our target users are individuals that are ready to settle down and raise a family. Our users want to know information about different cities that are looking to settle down in. They might get recommendations from their friends and family on where to settle, and they will want to research those recommendations. They might also want to search for cities that match parameters they want before they settle there. Our web application will allow users to search cities up in our search for cities feature and find out more information about that particular city. Additionally, they can search for parameters that they want a city to have and they can find cities that suffice. Given information about the city that are researching and given cities to research further, our users will be satisfied with the information that they are given, and they will make the right decision on where to settle down and raise their families.

3. milestone5.md contains screenshots of your latest UI webpages embedded directly within the file.

4. milestone5.md contains a written explanation of how your UI's screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone4.md.

Our UI has improved from milestone4 to milestone5, we added color to our tabs so that they are not transparent and we have changed the way our data is visualized. We would put the information for each city in more manageable pieces so that our users will be able to better utilize the information that we were given. Better and more constantly organized information across multiple cuties will allow our users to see how the city they are researching stacks up against other cities they are looking to settle down in.

5. milestone5.md contains screenshots of how your data is displayed or visualized within your app. Include these as separate screenshots in addition to the general UI screenshots in rubric item 2. (You don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)

6. milestone5.md contains a written explanation of how you implemented your data display or visualizations, such as which libraries/frameworks you used (if any), how you hooked up to data APIs or databases, etc. (Again, you don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.) (2 points)

7.milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel free to be more creative here.

Some ambitious data display or visualizations ideas we have is being able to search up multiple cities at once and see how they compare side by side (like the compare products view from Amazon and BestBuy websites). Being able to compare directly side by side would give our users the best chance of seeing how multiple cities compare against one another. This is vital because we want to give our users the information to make it possible and easier to choose the absolute best city area to settle down and live in. Having that information from multiple cities side by side will help better determine which city is the best for our users.

For better data display and visualization ideas, we could introduce the rating grades like RateMyProfessor, because all the data contains multi-digit values, so it would not be obvious enough for a user to know whether the value is greater or smaller than other cities right away. Therefore, if we could quantify they to different levels or grades like ABCDE or in other ways, that would make the data display and visualization more easily to be understood by the users right away. 


8. You can show your TA that the data that is displayed in your app's frontend are powered by real data and not simply mock-up fake data or snippets from example code (2 points).

9. You can walk through all the code you wrote to implement your data display or rendering, and explain how it works at a high level (2 points).

10. You successfully walk through all of the major functionality of your app so far by demoing in-person to your TA (2 points).

11.During your walk through demo, your TA will now play the role of a new user seeing your demo for the first time; you can successfully answer questions they ask from the perspective of a complete novice who doesn't know your app at all (e.g., imagine showing it to some random person at a coffee shop) (2 points).

12. Your demo and TA questions do not reveal any major bugs or pieces of obvious missing functionality (it's OK if there are small minor bugs, you will get full credit here as long as it mostly works) (2 points).
