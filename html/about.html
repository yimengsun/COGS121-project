	<h3>Family Friendly is designed for adults looking to start a family in California but don't know exactly where to settle down. Our ideal users would have some idea on where they want to settle, but they want to know more about the area. Users can otherwise havesome parameters that they can input into our parameter search so that they can see cities that fit their criteria, which they can then look further at the details of by using our search function. We have two central functions, Search for a California City and Search for Specific Parameters.</h3><br>
	<h3>Search for California City is a function that is self descriptive. Simply input the name of a city in California, and hit send. You will be taken to a page that will show you the city on a map, and you can browse the information we gathered of that city. This information is especially important to those that wish to start families. We have the demographics of that city, as well as the number of schools and the weather. All this is important for those that are raising a family. For example, if an Asian couple wants to raise their family with a lot of Asian Culture surrounding them, perhaps they'll prefer a city with a large Asian Percentage.<br><br></h3> 
	<h3> Search for Specific Parameters is a function where a user can search for cities that fit their specific parameters. They will be given a list of cities that are near to your parameters so that you can get ideas on where to settle down. You can also our Search for California City function to look at more information about that particular city.
