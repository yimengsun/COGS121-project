1. As you can see, milestone2.md is present in our project GitHub repository.

2. We got good feedback about our milestone1, we were able to hit on a good idea. We have decided to stay with the same idea, and so our idea is very similar to what we proposed in milestone1.md

milestone2.md contains screenshots of all your UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file (not linked as external image files).


milestone2.md contains a written explanation of how your screenshots are similar to or differ from your paper prototypes in milestone1.md; it's perfectly okay if they are different (e.g., if you needed to change your initial idea), as long as you justify the changes.
