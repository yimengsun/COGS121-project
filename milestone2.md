1. As you can see, milestone2.md is present in our project GitHub repository.

2. We got good feedback about our milestone1, we were able to hit on a good idea. We have decided to stay with the same idea, and so our idea is very similar to what we proposed in milestone1.md

3. Screenshots of our UI Skeleton webpages

4. Our screenshots are similar to our paper prototypes in that we have a page where we can search for zipcodes and also search by parameters we deem important. For our first web page, You can search for a specific zipcode on the left side. On the right side, we will be able to search by different parameters, we don't have the parameters input section yet, but we will put those in later. Both of these features will go to the same results page, shown in the second screenshot. We decided on this because, we were able to make the user Interaction very simple. We wanted the user experience to be much more intuitive, and so we decided on limiting the number of pages we had the user had to go to. We also have a login page so we could potentially save the user's information, shown in screenShot 3.

5. We will demo our UI skeleton webpages live to our TA from a web server, apache2 and mySQL

6. We will properly explain to our TA how our server backend works at a high level by walking him through it.

7. Our UI skeleton webpages contains working links to one another

8. Screen #1 is complete in that it introduces the app and shows users what can be done

9. SCreen #1 includes all buttons needed to perform tasks that can be done on that screen, 

10. Screen #2 is easily discoverable by following buttons from the home page. Users can press the submit and search button to go to the second page.

11. Screen #2 will include the information we get from apis, we have Dummy data right now, but put some of the parts we care about. We put tabs for security, schools, and parks.

12. We will live demo one ajax interaction so that our TA can trigger some action on our webpages, it will fetch some data, and display that data directly on the webpage without reloading it.

13.Our Ajax interaction is relevant to our project, even if the data is faked.

14. We will explain to our TA how the Ajax interaction works by walking through our frontend and backend code that we wrote for it.

15. We will tell our TA a plan for what real data you are going to use for our project, we are going to obtain info from open source data sets.
