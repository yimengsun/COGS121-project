1. As you can see, milestone2.md is present in our project GitHub repository.

2. We got good feedback about our milestone1, we were able to hit on a good idea. We have decided to stay with the same idea, and so our idea is very similar to what we proposed in milestone1.md

3. Screenshots of our UI Skeleton webpages

4. Our screenshots are similar to our paper prototypes in that we have a page where we can search for zipcodes and also search by parameters we deem important. For our first web page, You can search for a specific zipcode on the left side. On the right side, we will be able to search by different parameters, we don't have the parameters input section yet, but we will put those in later. Both of these features will go to the same results page, shown in the second screenshot. We decided on this because, we were able to make the user Interaction very simple. We wanted the user experience to be much more intuitive, and so we decided on limiting the number of pages we had the user had to go to. We also have a login page so we could potentially save the user's information, shown in screenShot 3.
