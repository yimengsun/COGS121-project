milestone2.md contains a written explanation of how your idea is similar to or differs from what you proposed in milestone1.md for Milestone 1 (it's OK if you kept the same idea, just say that you kept it the same so we know; or if your TA suggested you change your idea, write how you did so)

milestone2.md contains screenshots of all your UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file (not linked as external image files).


milestone2.md contains a written explanation of how your screenshots are similar to or differ from your paper prototypes in milestone1.md; it's perfectly okay if they are different (e.g., if you needed to change your initial idea), as long as you justify the changes.
